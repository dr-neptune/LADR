** 2.A | Span and Linear Independence

*** Definition | Linear Combination 

A linear combination of a list $v_1, ..., v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is a vector of the form $a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m$, where $a_1, ..., a_m \in F$. 

*** Definition | Span

The set of all linear combinations of a list of vectors $v_1, ..., v_m$ in $V$ is called the span of $v_1, ..., v_m$, denoted span$(v_1, ..., v_m)$. In other words, span$(v_1, ..., v_m) = \{a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m : a_1, ..., a_m \in F\}$.

The span of the empty list is defined to be $\{0\}$.

*** Theorem | Span is the smallest containing subspace 

The span of a list of vectors in $V$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ containing all the vectors in the list. 

*** Definition | Spans 

If span$(v_1, ..., v_m)$ equals $V$, we say that $v_1, ..., v_m$ spans $V$

*** Definition | Finite-Dimensional Vector Space 

A vector space is called finite-dimensional if some list of vectors in it spans the space 

*** Definition | Polynomial $\mathcal{P}(F)$

- A function $p: F \to F$ is called a polynomial with coefficients in $F$ if there exist $a_0, ..., a_m \in F$ such that $p(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + ... + a_m z^m$ for all $z \in F$
- $\mathcal{P}(F)$ is the set of all polynomials with coefficients in $F$ 

The coefficients of a polynomial are uniquely determined by the polynomial. 

*** Definition | Degree of a Polynomial, deg $p$

- A polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(F)$ is said to have degree $m$ if there exist scalars $a_0, a_1, ..., a_m \in F$ with $a_m \neq 0$ such that $p(z) = a_0 + a_1z + ... + a_mz^m$ for all $z \in F$. If $p$ has degree $m$, we write deg $p = m$.
- The polynomial that is identically 0 is said to have degree $- \infty$ 

*** Definition | $\mathcal{P}_m(F)$ 

For $m$, a nonnegative integer $\mathcal{P}_m(F)$ denotes the set of all polynomials with coefficients in $F$ with degree at most $m$

*** Definition | infinite-dimensional vector space 

A vector space is called infinite-dimensional if it is not finite-dimensional 

*** Definition | Linearly Independent 

- A list $v_1, ..., v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is called linearly independent if the only choice of $a_1, ..., a_m \in F$ that makes $a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m$ equal 0 is $a_1 = ... = a_m = 0$.
- The empty list () is also declared to be linearly independent

The reasoning above shows that $v_1, ..., v_m$ is linearly independent iff each vector in span $(v_1, ..., v_m)$ has only one representation as a linear combination of $v_1, ..., v_m$. 

*** Definition | Linearly Dependent 

- A list of vectors $V$ is called linearly dependent if it is not linearly independent
- In other words, a list $v_1, ..., v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is linearly dependent if there exist $a_1, ..., a_m \in F$, not all 0, such that $a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m = 0$. 

*** Lemma | Linear Dependence Lemma 

Suppose $v_1, ..., v_m$ is a linearly dependent list in $V$. Then there exists $j \in \{1, 2, ..., m\}$ such that the following hold: 
- $v_j \in \mathrm{span}(v_1, ..., v_{j - 1})$
- if the jth term is removed from $v_1, ..., v_m$, the span of the remaining list equals $\mathrm{span}(v_1, ..., v_m)$. 

*** Theorem | Length of Linearly Independent List $\leq$ Length of Spanning List

In a finite-dimensional vector space, the length of every linearly independent list of vectors is less than or equal to the length of every spanning list of vectors. 

*** Theorem | Finite-Dimensional Subspaces 

Every subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is finite-dimensional
