** 2.A | Span and Linear Independence

*** Definition | Linear Combination 

A linear combination of a list $v_1, ..., v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is a vector of the form $a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m$, where $a_1, ..., a_m \in F$. 

*** Definition | Span

The set of all linear combinations of a list of vectors $v_1, ..., v_m$ in $V$ is called the span of $v_1, ..., v_m$, denoted span$(v_1, ..., v_m)$. In other words, span$(v_1, ..., v_m) = \{a_1v_1 + ... + a_mv_m : a_1, ..., a_m \in F\}$.

The span of the empty list is defined to be $\{0\}$.

*** Theorem | Span is the smallest containing subspace 

The span of a list of vectors in $V$ is the smallest subspace of $V$ containing all the vectors in the list. 

*** Definition | Spans 

If span$(v_1, ..., v_m)$ equals $V$, we say that $v_1, ..., v_m$ spans $V$

*** Definition | Finite-Dimensional Vector Space 

A vector space is called finite-dimensional if some list of vectors in it spans the space
