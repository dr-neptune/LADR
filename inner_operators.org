*** Definition | Adjoint $T^*$

Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. The adjoint of $T$ is the function $T^* : W \to V$ such that $\langle Tv, w \rangle = \langle v, T^* w \rangle$ for every $v \in V$ and every $w \in W$. 

*** Theorem | The adjoint is a linear map 

If $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$, then $T^* \in \mathcal{L}(W, V)$

*** Theorem | Properties of the Adjoint 

- $(S + T)^* = S^* + T^*$ for all $S, T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$
- $(\lambda T)^* = \bar{\lambda}T^*$ for all $\lambda \in F$ and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$
- $(T^*)^* = T$ for all $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$
- $I^* = I$, where $I$ is the identity operator on $V$
- $(ST)^* = T^* S^*$ for all $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$ and $S \in \mathcal{L}(W, U)$ where $U$ is an inner product space over $F$ 

*** Theorem | Null Space and Range of $T^*$

Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Then 
- null $T^*$ = $(\mathrm{range} T)^{\perp}$
- range $T^*$ = $(\mathrm{null}T)^{\perp}$
- null $T$ = $(\mathrm{range} T^*)^{\perp}$
- range $T$ = $(\mathrm{null} T^*)^{\perp}$ 

*** Definition | Conjugate Transpose 

The conjugate transpose of an m-by-n matrix is the n-by-m matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns and then taking the complex conjugate of each entry

*** Theorem | The matrix of $T^*$ 

Let $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Suppose $e_1, ..., e_n$ is an orthonormal basis of $V$ and $f_1, ..., f_m$ is an orthonormal basis of $W$. Then 

$\mathcal{M}(T^*, (f_1, ..., f_m), (e_1, ..., e_n))$

is the conjugate transpose of 

$\mathcal{M}(T, (e_1, ..., e_n), (f_1, ..., f_m))$

*** Definition | self-adjoint 

An operator $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is called self-adjoint if $T = T^*$. In other words, $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is self-adjoint iff $\langle Tv, w \rangle = \langle w, Tv \rangle$ for all $v, w \in V$

A good analogy to keep in mind (especially when $F = C$) is that the adjoint on $\mathcal{L}(V)$ plays a role similar to complex conjugation on $C$. A complex number $z$ is real iff $z = \bar{z}$; thus a self-adjoint operator ($T = T^*$) is analogous to a real number.  

*** Theorem | Eigenvalues of Self-Adjoint Operators are Real 

Every eigenvalue of a self-adjoint operator is real 

*** Theorem | Over $C$, $Tv$ is orthogonal to $v$ for all $v$ only for the $0$ operator 

Suppose $V$ is a complex inner product space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Suppose $\langle Tv, v \rangle = 0$ for all $v \in V$. Then $T = 0$. 

*** Theorem | Over $C$, $\langle Tv, v \rangle$ is real for all $v$ only for self-adjoint operators  

Suppose $V$ is a complex inner product space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Then $T$ is self-adjoint iff $\langle Tv, v \rangle \in R$ for every $v \in V$. 

*** Theorem | If $T = T^*$ and $\langle Tv, v \rangle = 0$ for all $v$, then $T = 0$

*** Definition | normal 

- An operator on an inner product space is called normal if it commutes with its adjoint
- In other words, $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is normal if $T T^* = T^* T$
