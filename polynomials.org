*** Definition re $z$, Im $z$

Suppose $z = a + bi$, where $a, b \in R$. 
- The real part of $z$, denoted Re $z$, is defined by Re $z = a$
- The imaginary part of $z$, denoted Im $z$, is defined by Im $z = b$

*** Definition | complex conjugate $\bar{z}$, absolute value $|z|$

Suppose $z \in C$. 

- The complex conjugate of $z \in C$, denoted $\bar{z}$, is defined by $\bar{z} =$ Re $z$ - (Im $z$)$i$
- The absolute value of a complex number $z$, denoted $|z|$, is defined by $|z| = \sqrt{(\mathrm{Re}z)^2 + (\mathrm{Im}z)^2}$

*** Theorem | Properties of Complex Numbers 

Suppose $w, z \in C$. Then 

- sum of $z$ and $\bar{z}$ 
  - $z + \bar{z} = 2 \mathrm{Re}z$

- difference of $z$ and $\bar{z}$
  - $z - \bar{z} = 2 \mathrm{Im}zi$

- product of $z$ and $\bar{z}$
  - $z\bar{z} = |z|^2$

- Additivity and Multiplicativity of Complex Conjugate 
  - $\bar{w + z} = \bar{w} + \bar{z}$ and $\bar{wz} = \bar{w}\bar{z}$

- conjugate of conjugate 
  - $\bar{\bar{z}} = z$

- real and imaginary parts are bounded by $|z|$
  - $|\mathrm{Re} z| \leq |z|$ and $|\mathrm{Im}z| \leq |z|$

- Absolute value of the complex conjugate 
  - $|\bar{z}| = |z|$

- multiplicativity of absolute value 
  - $|wz| = |w||z|$

- Triangle Inequality 
  - $|w + z| \leq |w| + |z|$
